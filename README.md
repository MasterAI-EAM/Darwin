**Organization: [University of New South Wales（UNSW) AI4Science](https://www.masterai.com.au) & [GreenDynamics Pty. Ltd](https://www.greendynamics.com.au)**

Darwin is an open-source project dedicated to fine-tuning the LLaMA model on scientific literature and datasets. Specifically designed for the scientific domain with an emphasis on materials science, chemistry, and physics, Darwin integrates structured and unstructured scientific knowledge to enhance the efficacy of language models in scientific research. We provide a colab to try out inference of Darwin: **[inference.ipynb](https://github.com/MasterAI-EAM/Darwin/blob/main/inference.ipynb)** (Note: For common use, we use CPU by default. If you want to use GPU, please modify the code according to comments in notebook. If !gdown command cannot download the darwin-7b.zip successfully, you can download from onedrive and upload to colab manually, or upload to your own google drive and replace the link in !gdown command)

## Model Overview

Darwin, based on the 7B LLaMA model, is trained on over 100,000 instruction-following data points generated by the Darwin Scientific Instruction Generator (SIG) from various scientific FAIR datasets and a literature corpus. By focusing on the factual correctness of the model's responses, Darwin represents a significant stride towards leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific discovery. Preliminary human evaluations indicate that Darwin 7B outperforms GPT-4 in scientific Q&A and fine-tuned GPT-3 in solving chemistry problems (like gptChem).

We are actively developing Darwin for more advanced scientific domain experiments, and we're also integrating Darwin with LangChain to solve more complex scientific tasks (like a private research assistant for personal computers).

Please note, Darwin is still under development, and many limitations need to be addressed. Most importantly, we have yet to fine-tune Darwin for maximum safety. We encourage users to report any concerning behavior to help improve the model's safety and ethical considerations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

First install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Preparing the Darwin Weights

Download the checkpoints of the Darwin-7B Weights from [onedrive](https://aigreendynamics-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yuwei_greendynamics_com_au/Euu1OzZTOS5OsQvVTRNV_gcBa67ehvk6uN6hJIHnBLOkDg?e=x5wxfk). Once you've downloaded the model, you can try our demo:
```bash 
python inference.py <your path to darwin-7b>
```

Please note, the inference requires at least 10GB of GPU memory for Darwin 7B. We are working on a Colab version of the demo.

## Fine-tuning
To further fine-tune our Darwin-7b with different datasets, below is a command that works on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs.
```bash
torchrun  --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=1212 train.py \
    --model_name_or_path <your path to darwin-7b> \
    --data_path <your path to dataset> \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your output dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 1 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 500 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LlamaDecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 False
```

## Datasets Information

Our data comes from two primary sources:

A raw literature corpus containing 6.0M papers on materials science, chemistry, and physics was published after 2000. The publishers include ACS, RSC, Springer Nature, Wiley, and Elsevier. We thank them for their support.

FAIR Datasets - We've collected data from 10 FAIR Datasets.

### Data Generation
We developed Darwin-SIG to generate scientific instructions. It can memorize long texts from full literature texts (average ~5000 words) and generate question-and-answer (Q&A) data based on scientific literature keywords (from **[web of science API](https://github.com/Clarivate-SAR/wos-excel-converter))**

> Note: You could also use GPT3.5 or GPT-4 for generation, but these options might be costly.

Please be aware that we can't share the training dataset due to agreements with the publishers.
